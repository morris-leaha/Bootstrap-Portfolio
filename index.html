                        I consider myself to be a meticulous, proactive, individual as well as a strong team-player with outstanding time-management, organizational, and interpersonal skills.  All of these qualities can be seen throughout my various employment history.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        For example, throughout the past few years of pursuing my Master of Science in Biological Sciences degree at DePaul University and conducting my own research within the field of reproductive biology, I have also worked as the Lead Microbiology Teaching Assistant and as both part-time and full-time restaurant servers within fast-paced, dynamic, settings—all while maintaining a 4.00 cumulative GPA.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        With a passion to be continuously learning, I've been indulging in self-teaching a couple basic coding languages with any spare time found for myself. Starting with up to date HTML5 and CSS3, I've become infatuated with learning more and have recently decided to fully dive into the tech world next! I will now be "shifting-gears" and directing my attention on pursuing what it takes to become a full-stack web developer, focusing primarily on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Stack.

                        If you have also switched career trajectories, or are currently doing so as well, I'd love to chat and connect with you—I'll always welcome any advice, or a good joke or two!
